    "Over the course of two weeks, we will implement an agent that can play the pen-and-paper game _Battleships_. The goal of this exercise sheet is to find exact prior probabilities of getting a hit by enumeration, and to update to a posterior given observations of hits and misses. This week we will understand why we can't construct the agent with this approach.  \n",
